Working Together
We have org, and repo on it
Everyone forked it / made a copy of it
And cloned it to our computers
Add the orgs git url as a new remote called upstream
Then work away!
When your code is in a good spot, make a commit
And push it to your origin(your fork)
Make a pull request to the org so that everyone gets that code
!important DO NOT merge your own pull request 
Then everyone do a git pull upstream master 
Repeat
